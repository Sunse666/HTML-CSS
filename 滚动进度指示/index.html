    <p>Usage
    Ionicons is a completely open-source icon set with 1,300 icons crafted for web, iOS, Android, and desktop apps. Ionicons was made for Ionic Framework, a cross-platform hybrid and Progressive Web App framework.

    Using the Web Component
    The Ionicons Web Component is an easy and performant way to use Ionicons in your app. The component will dynamically load an SVG for each icon, so your app is only requesting the icons that you need.

    Also note that only visible icons are loaded, and icons which are "below the fold" and hidden from the user's view do not make fetch requests for the svg resource.

    Installation
    If you're using Ionic Framework, Ionicons is packaged by default, so no installation is necessary. Want to use Ionicons without Ionic Framework? Place the following.
    Variants
    Each app icon in Ionicons has a filled, outline and sharp variant. These different variants are provided to make your app feel native to a variety of platforms. The filled variant uses the default name without a suffix. Note: Logo icons do not have outline or sharp variants.
    Platform specificity
    When using icons in Ionic Framework you can specify different icons per platform. Use the md and ios
    Size
    To specify the icon size, you can use the size attribute for our pre-defined font sizes.
    Or you can set a specific size by applying the font-size CSS property on the ion-icon
    Stroke width
    When using an outline icon variant it is possible to adjust the stroke width, for improved visual balance relative to the icon's size or relative to the width of adjacent text. You can set a specific size by applying the --ionicon-stroke-width CSS custom property to the ion-icon component. The default value is 32px.
    Accessibility
    Icons that are purely decorative content should have aria-hidden="true"
    Alternatively, if the icon is inside of another element that it is describing, that element should have the aria-label added to it, and the icon should be hidden usingaria-hidden
